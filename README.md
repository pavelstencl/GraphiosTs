# GraphiosTs
Typescript GraphQl client built on top of Axios.

## Features
- Communicates with GraphQl server.
- Has all features of Axios js client - [GitHub](https://github.com/axios/axios).
- Uses one GraphQl schema (translated to TS) as single source of truth.
- Guards validity of written query ([Visualisation](https://github.com/pavelstencl/GraphiosTs/blob/master/media/example1.gif)).
- Guards changes on a GraphQL schema (with TS-lint).
- Returns strongly typed response based on a query ([Visualisation](https://github.com/pavelstencl/GraphiosTs/blob/master/media/example2.gif)).
- GraphiosTS schema can be synced with GraphQL server schema via GraphiosTsCmd (UPDATE TO GIT NEEDED).
- Supports GraphQl Aliases ([Visualisation](https://github.com/pavelstencl/GraphiosTs/blob/master/media/example4.gif)) and Inline Fragments ([Visualisation](https://github.com/pavelstencl/GraphiosTs/blob/master/media/example3.gif))
